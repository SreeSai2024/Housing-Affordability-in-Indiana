# Housing-Affordability-in-Indiana

🚀 Project Highlight: Housing Affordability in Indiana 🏡📊

Excited to share my latest project, where I analyzed housing affordability in Indiana using machine learning and deep learning models. Leveraging Census Bureau data from 2010 to 2021, I explored key socioeconomic factors like income distribution, poverty levels, property values, and unemployment to understand their impact on housing costs.

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used: ✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch)
✅ API Integration (Census Bureau API for dataset extraction)
✅ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
✅ Machine Learning Models (Decision Trees)
✅ Deep Learning Model (Neural Network with PyTorch)
✅ Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)

📌 Key Findings:
✔️ Higher poverty rates and unemployment significantly impact affordability.
✔️ Decision Trees provide better interpretability, while Deep Learning offers higher predictive accuracy.
✔️ The median income and yearly housing costs are crucial factors in affordability predictions.

This project not only strengthened my data analysis and modeling skills but also provided meaningful insights into a critical issue. Always excited to tackle real-world challenges with AI!
